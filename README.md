# Coin-Tossing-Game
+ A Coin Tossing Game Simulation

+ Mojtaba tosses a coin for his friends, Harry and Tom, exactly 100 times. Harry wins $1.00 when a head lands up, and Tom loses $1.00, Tom wins when the coin lands with tails up, with Harry paying $1. Mojtaba tracks their respective wins and losses as they play the game. On any toss, Harry could be ahead, or Tom could be ahead, or they could be even.

+ On any game (a game being exactly 100 tosses), is it more likely that both Harry and Tom are each ahead on about 1/2 of the tosses, or is it more likely that one of the two is ahead most of the time?

+ Note that we are not asking about Winnings at the end of the game; we are not asking about the proportion of heads versus tails (which, as you know, should be close to 50:50 in the long run). The question concerns how often Harry or Tom is ahead or behind during the course of the game.
+ Note also that the two Possibilities in the question are not the only two possible results of a game; therefore, their probabilities will not add up to 1.

+ To be specific, which of these is more likely, and by about how much?

+ (A) Harry and Tom are each ahead on about 1/2 of the tosses; Specifically, Harry is ahead on 45 to 55 of the tosses, and thus Tom is also ahead on 45 to 55 of the tosses; or

+ (B) Harry is ahead on 95 or more tosses; or

+ (C) Harry is ahead on 5 or fewer tosses.

+ You can change Head and Tail probability and number of tossing and repeat.
